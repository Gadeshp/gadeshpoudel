            <h2>衷心欢迎 </h2>
            <p>Xi’an University (Xi'an-U), with the approval of the Ministry of
                Education of the People's Republic of China, is a full-time undergraduate
                 university and the only one that is managed by Xi’an Municipal Government.
                 The university is located at XI’AN national high tech zone and  covers an 
                 area of 50 hectares with a total structure area of 350,000 square meters. 
                 The university boasts a collection of more than 1,200,000 volumes in library 
                 and the teaching equipment totals 11 million USD in value. The university now
                  has an enrollment of 13, 000 full-time undergraduate students. The university
                   offers 37 bachelor programs, covering nine disciplines in Libera Arts,
                   Natural Science, Engineering, Education, Management, Law, History and Agriculture.
               Unique featured, high qualitied, society-served --- It is the philosophy 
               that we firmly believed for years to cultivate our students to be outstanding and talented.
               In contemporary society, with internationalization of higher education, 
               we have always been committed to building our university into an open one. 
               Xi'an-U has been maintaining scholarly and academic relations with more than 
               ten universities in UK, US, Ukraine, Belgium, Japan, Thailand and so on. Lately, 
               five collaborative memorandums that Xi'an-U have signed with foreign higher 
               education institutes including University of Waterloo, Wright state university, etc.
               We strongly hope and are willing to establish corporations with outside world so
                as to create better opportunities for development of our teaching and academics. 
                Meanwhile，we shall leave no stone unturned to accelerate process of university’s 
                internationalization and enhance scientific innovation.</p>

            <h2>Professor Song Limei Obtains National Invention Patent</h2>
            <p>Recently, the scientific research results ofa water-soluble terbium-doped calcium fluoride nano particles, preparation method and application conducted by Prof. Song Limei with her research groupobtained the national invention patent authorization (Patent number: ZL201810175271 .9). The invention provides a water-soluble terbium-doped calcium fluoride nano particle and preparing method. The rice particle can identify transition metal ions, and solves the problem that the terbium-doped fluoride that can be dissolved in water is rarely prepared in the prior art. The water solubility and luminescence intensity of the prepared nano particles and terbium-doped nano particles are contradictory. The preparation method of the invention is simple, easy to amplify, good controllability, and excellent product performance, and is expected to be used in analytical chemistry, biology, medical fluorescent probes, tracers, anti-counterfeiting and other fields.

                　　Introduction to the thermal barrier materials research team: The team was established in September 2020 and currently has 6 teachers (Li Jing, Wang Liuchang, Zhu Gang, Ren Hongjiang, Song Limei, and Li Jiangtao) and 12 undergraduates taking part in undergraduate training program for innovation and entrepreneurship . The team adheres to the concept of subject integration and mutual intersection. The series of organic small molecule drugs, rare earth fluorides and manganese oxide compound nano materials, carbon/silicon composite materials that have been synthesized have shown good results in antibacterial and anti-inflammatory, luminescence analysis, and energy storage. Application prospects, scientific research results have been published in internationally renowned journals in this field.</p>
